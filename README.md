This is an example of using Webpack, Vue, Vuex, and ES6 module Hot Module Replacement functionality made for the presentation at JavaScript Ljubljana meetup.

# Installation

Move into the folder and

`npm install`

Start HMR watcher

`npm run hot`

Open browser at `http://localhost:8080`


Start changing the code and observe the magic.

You can change template, JS code, CSS or state and you will see changes reflected immediately. Try first adding a couple of messages and change the code after. It's magical!
